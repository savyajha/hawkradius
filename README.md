## Getting Started

1. Install this starter by running

    ```bash
    gatsby new try-ghost https://github.com/styxlab/gatsby-starter-try-ghost
    ```

2. Change directory

    ```bash
    cd try-ghost
    ```

3. Run

    ```bash
    gatsby develop
    ```
    and visit your site at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Configure

```js
    //siteConfig.js
    module.exports = {
        // Do not include a trailing slash!
        siteUrl: `https://your-blog.com`,

        // Maximum number of post shown per page
        // Infinite Scroll: Initial chunk of posts, subsequent posts are fetched one by one
        postsPerPage: 3, 
    
        // This allows an alternative site title for meta data for pages.
        siteTitleMeta: `Gatsby Starter Ghost CMS`, 

        // This allows an site description for meta data for pages.
        siteDescriptionMeta: `Turn your Ghost blog into a flaring fast static site with Gatsby`, 
    
        // Change to the width and height of your default share image
        shareImageWidth: 1000, 
        shareImageHeight: 523,
    
        // Used for App and Offline manifest e.g. Mobile Home Screen
        shortTitle: `Ghost`, 
        siteIcon: `favicon.png`, 
        backgroundColor: `#e9e9e9`,
        themeColor: `#15171A`,

        // Select inline texts based on your locale
        locale: `en`,
        
        // Overwrite navigation menu (default: []), label is case sensitive
        // overwriteGhostNavigation: [{ label: `Home`, url: `/` }],
    }
```

In the configuration shown above, the most important fields to be changed are `siteUrl`, `siteTitleMeta` and `siteDescriptionMeta`. Update at least those to fit your needs.


## Ghost Content API keys

All content is sourced from a Ghost CMS. By default, content is fetched from the demo location at `https://cms.gotsby.org`. Surely you want to source your own content. In your base directory `try-ghost`, add a new file `.ghost.json` that contains the following JSON structure:

```bash

    {
        "development": {
            "apiUrl": "http://localhost:2368",
            "contentApiKey": "9fccdb0e4ea5b572e2e5b92942"
        },
        "production": {
            "apiUrl": "http://localhost:2368",
            "contentApiKey": "9fccdb0e4ea5b572e2e5b92942"
        }
    }
```

Change the url and keys to match your own Ghost CMS Content API keys.

## Deploy

```bash
    gatsby build
```

After completion of the build process your static site can be found in the `public/` folder. Copy those files over to your webserver.

## Deploy on Gatsby Cloud

Fork `gatsby-starter-try-ghost` in GitHub. After logging into Gatsby Cloud make sure Gatsby Cloud has access rights to your forked repository. Select *I already have a Gatsby Site* and then pick *gatsby-starter-try-ghost*. Skip integrations. For a first test also skip content keys. The build should start immediately and show the demo site. Provide content keys in order to source in your own content from Ghost CMS.

## Ensure headless mode of Ghost CMS

For best SEO results it is strongly recommended to disable the default Ghost Handlebars theme front-end by selecting the *Make this site private* flag within your Ghost admin settings. This enables password protection in front of the Ghost install and sets `<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />` so your Gatsby front-end becomes the authoritative source for search engines.
